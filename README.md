# zx0-6803

**zx0-6803** is a Motorola 6803 decompressor for the [ZX0](https://github.com/einar-saukas/ZX0) data compression format by Einar Saukas. ZX0 provides a tradeoff between high compression ratio and extremely simple fast decompression.

## Usage

To compress a file, use the command-line compressor from https://github.com/einar-saukas/ZX0 with the "-c" flag or https://github.com/emmanuel-marty/salvador with the "-classic" flag.

_**WARNING**: The ZX0 file format was changed in version 2. This library uses version 1._
